## Content

   * **Be specific, not generic.** Replace vague claims of importance with concrete facts.
     "Inventor of the first train-coupling device" instead of "a revolutionary titan of
     industry."
   * **Skip the significance speeches.** Do not add sentences about how something "marks a
     pivotal moment," "represents a broader trend," "highlights the enduring legacy," or
     "underscores the importance." Let facts speak for themselves.
   * **Avoid superficial analysis.** Do not attach "-ing" phrases that editorialize:
     "creating a lively community," "showcasing the brand's dedication," "demonstrating
     ongoing relevance."
   * **No promotional language.** Cut puffery like "nestled within," "vibrant," "rich
     tapestry," "seamlessly connecting," "gateway to," "breathtaking." Write neutrally.
   * **Attribute specifically or not at all.** Do not use weasel phrases like "has been
     described as," "is considered," "researchers note," "scholars argue" without naming
     who. If you cannot name a source, remove the claim.
   * **Do not exaggerate consensus.** Do not present one or two sources as "several
     publications" or "multiple scholars." Do not imply lists are non-exhaustive when
     sources give no indication other examples exist.
   * **Skip "Challenges and Future Prospects" formulas.** Do not write "Despite its
     [positive words], [subject] faces challenges..." followed by vague optimism about
     future initiatives.
   * **No hedging preambles.** Do not acknowledge something is "relatively minor" before
     explaining its importance anyway.

## Word Choice

Avoid overused AI vocabulary:

   * **High-frequency offenders:** delve, tapestry, landscape, multifaceted, intricate,
     nuanced, pivotal, comprehensive, innovative, cutting-edge, groundbreaking,
     transformative, paradigm, foster, leverage, spearhead, underscore, highlight,
     crucial, vital, robust, seamless, holistic, synergy, realm, beacon, testament,
     embark, unveil, unravel, commendable, meticulous, intrinsic, Moreover,
     Furthermore, Notably, Importantly, Indeed, Thus, Hence, Therefore,
     Consequently
   * One or two may be coincidental; clusters are evidence of overuse

## Grammar & Structure

   * **Use simple verbs.** Prefer "is" and "are" over "serves as," "stands as," "marks,"
     "represents," "constitutes," "features," "offers." Write "She is chairman" not
     "She serves as chairman."
   * **Avoid negative parallelisms.** Do not write "not only ... but also," "it's not just
     about ... it's ...," "not ... but rather." These constructions try to appear balanced
     but often add nothing.
   * **Break the rule of three.** Do not default to "adjective, adjective, and adjective"
     or "phrase, phrase, and phrase" patterns. Vary list lengths.
   * **Avoid elegant variation.** If you name something, use that name again. Do not cycle
     through synonyms like "the protagonist," "the key player," "the eponymous character"
     to avoid repetition.
   * **No false ranges.** "From X to Y" requires a real scale. "From the Big Bang to the
     cosmic web" or "from problem-solving to artistic expression" are meaningless ranges
     that sound impressive but say nothing.

## Formatting & Style

   * **Use sentence case for headings.** Do not capitalize every word in section titles.
   * **Avoid excessive boldface.** Do not bold every key term or create "key takeaways"
     lists with bolded headers.
   * **No emojis** unless explicitly requested

## Communication

   * **No meta-commentary.** Do not include phrases like "In this section, we will
     discuss..." or "Below is a detailed overview based on available information."
   * **No disclaimers about knowledge gaps.** Do not write "While specific details are not
     extensively documented..." or "As of my last knowledge update..."
   * **No placeholder text.** Do not leave brackets like [describe the specific section]
     or dates like 2025-XX-XX.
   * **No collaborative language in output.** Do not write "Would you like me to..." or
     "Here's a template you can customize" in content meant for publication.
